For Video Splitter to work ---> need to add video.mp4 files to split.py directory.

Run python module from same directory as main.py
--> Run in Anaconda PowerShell for least issues
--Import cv2 in python shell
--> Quit Python Shell
-->run split.py

Frames should output to /data. 
If no /data then one will be created
